Hello! My name is Bruno Martins, a Computer Science graduate from Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, USA. I have a passion for technology and curiosity to learn and grow.

Currently, I am a developer for an e-commerce company. I specialize in Python, automation, scraping, Flask, Django, and databases. My technical proficiency has allowed me to build numerous tools that enhance productivity, streamline processes, and improve overall efficiency. My work focuses on developing innovative solutions to optimize product listings, automate repetitive tasks, and boost sales and customer satisfaction.

This website serves as a platform for me to share my learning journey, insights, and personal experiences.
